# CBBL python library

The objective of this library is to hold python packages, classes, methods, etc. that could be useful by the members of the CBBL computational laboratory.
Any code can be incorporated given that it is properly documented and is written with useful generalization in mind. There is much we need to agree upon on 
how this library will grow, but this should be the place to make python-based coding contributions to the lab so anyone can access and benefit from them.

Depenedencies should be listed in the setup.py script.
